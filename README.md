# Personalization techniques (for IoT devices)

Actually, the class is about recommender systems. Its name is "Personalization techniques for IoT devices" but our lectures will not handle any issue about IoT. The course covers the basic concepts of recommender systems, including personalization algorithms, evaluation tools, and user experiences. We will discuss how recommender systems are deployed in e-commerce sites, social networks, and many other online systems. Additionally, we will study the recent research topic about recommendation in the industry and academy.

Everyone is required to read about 20 research papers through the course and present at least a recent work of recommender system.

## Phase 1: Traditional recommendation systems

Every week, 2~3 research papers will be handed out and the next week, we will have about-1.5-hours-long quiz asking questions about those reading matters.

## Phase 2: Deep-leaerning based recommendation systems

Every week, 2~3 students present 40min presentation. Research papers for the presentation will be picked from
