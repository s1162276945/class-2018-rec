# Mining Personalized Data (in IoT devices)

Actually, the class is about recommender systems. Its name includes "IoT devices" but our lectures will not handle any issue about IoT. The course covers the basic concepts of recommender systems, including personalization algorithms, evaluation tools, and user experiences. We will discuss how recommender systems are deployed in e-commerce sites, social networks, and many other online systems. Additionally, we will study the recent research topic about recommendation in the industry and academy.

Everyone is required to read about 20 research papers through the course and present at least a recent work of recommender system.

## IMPORTANT NOTICE
* TIP FOR PRESENTATION: If it is too hard to understand the techniques in the assigned research paper, you can talk about the deep learning technique utilized in the assigned paper (e.g., If your paper is about a recommender system using Attention Mechanism (a popular and very effective technique in deep learning), then you can study and talk about Attention Mechanism)
* Changes: Term project -> final exam (Dec 13)

## Phase 1: Traditional recommendation systems

Every week, 2~3 research papers will be handed out and the next week, we will have about-1.5-hours-long quiz asking questions about those reading matters. You can refer to copies of the reading material for quiz. That is, it is an open-book test.
